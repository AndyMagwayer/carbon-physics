An atom is the smallest particle of an element that can exist on its own. In other words, if you have a bar of solid gold, the smallest particle that could exist by itself and still be considered gold would be one atom of gold.

# HI in this repository
i will try to demonstrate the work of atom, and what inside it, to be honest i really like this kind of projects,because since my childhood,
our family specilisez to the physics sphere and thay is why i really mad about job which i done, i hope , it will help u to increase your knowledge and get more and more
usefull information for yourselves which can help u to be in the order in the future)

o you ever look at the world around you and WONDER about what things are made of? As you begin to observe things more closely, you realize there are many levels at which you can examine things.

For example, consider the tasty campfire treat we call the s'more. What's it made of? That's easy! It's made of chocolate, marshmallow, and graham cracker. You can dig deeper, though.

What is the chocolate made of? What's a marshmallow anyway? How were the graham crackers made? If you look at the list of ingredients on a chocolate bar, a package of marshmallows, and a box of graham crackers, you'll realize there's much more than meets the eye.

Scientists learned long ago that that's pretty much true about everything in the world around us: there's much more than meets the eye. In fact, the tiniest building blocks of matter — called atoms — can only be "seen" with powerful electron microscopes.

An atom is the smallest particle of an element that can exist on its own. In other words, if you have a bar of solid gold, the smallest particle that could exist by itself and still be considered gold would be one atom of gold.

Atoms are composed of three primary particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Neutrons and protons together make up the dense center of an atom, known as the nucleus. Electrons orbit in shells in the space around the nucleus.

Neutrons have no charge, while electrons have a negative charge and protons have a positive charge. These charges are responsible for the electromagnetic force that keeps the electrons orbiting around the nucleus.

Atoms are curious particles when you think about them. Almost all of an atom's mass comes from the protons and neutrons in the nucleus. However, because electrons orbit around the nucleus, most of an atom is empty space! The nucleus only accounts for approximately 1/10,000th of the size of an atom.

You can't see atoms with the naked eye, because they're simply too small. Using electron microscopes, scientists have been able to study atoms.

An atom measures approximately 1/10th of a nanometer in diameter. That's about 100,000 times thinner than the average strand of human hair. If you made a straight line of 43 million iron atoms side by side, the line would only measure one millimeter long.

If all matter is made up of atoms, how do we get different elements? It all depends upon the internal structure of the atoms. Each element has atoms with a unique structure and a different number of protons. For example, each atom of hydrogen has one proton, while each atom of carbon has six protons.

Some elements even have more than one form. The other forms, called isotopes, have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. For example, hydrogen, which normally has no neutrons, has two isotopes: deuterium with one neutron and tritium with two neutrons.

What is an Atom 


It takes a large number of atoms to make up anything. There are too many atoms in the human body; we cannot count the number. There are various types of atoms depending upon the number of electrons, protons and neutrons every atom contains. Each unique type of atom makes up an element. There are 92 natural elements and up to 118 when you include man-made elements.


Inside the Atom
The Proton
The proton is a positively charged particle situated at the centre of the atom, inside the nucleus of an atom. The hydrogen atom is unique because it just has a single proton and no neutron in its nucleus.


The Electron
The electron is a negatively charged particle that spins around the nucleus. Electrons spin so quickly around the nucleus that researchers can never be 100 percent sure where they are found, yet researchers can mathematically assume where electrons should be. If there is a similar number of electrons and protons in an atom, then the atom is said to have a neutral charge. Electrons are drawn to the nucleus by the positive charge of the protons. Electrons are multiple times smaller than neutrons and protons. 


The Neutron
The neutron has no charge. They are present inside the nucleus of an atom, along with the protons. The number of neutrons influences the mass and the radioactivity of the atom.

Subatomic Particles of an Atom
For a long time, it was accepted that atoms are particles that matter is composed of and that these atoms can't be divided further. The observations of experiments related to an atom directed during the last half of the 19th century and early 20th century proved that the atom isn't a definitive particle. Scientists further confirmed the discovery of subatomic particles. The three fundamental subatomic particles that comprise an atom are electrons, protons, and neutrons.


Summary
Atoms have a very long life; they can stay forever also. They can change through chemical reactions, sharing electrons with different atoms. However, the nucleus is extremely difficult to part, meaning most atoms are around for quite a while.


Protons and neutrons are present in the atom's nucleus, whereas electrons revolve around them. The number of protons present in the nucleus of an atom decides which particle is going to produce. For example, if there are 79 protons in the nucleus of the atom, then it makes gold. If there are 8 protons in the nucleus of the atom, then it makes oxygen gas. In the same manner, many other elements are formed on our planet.
